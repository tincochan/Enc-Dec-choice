# Evaluation of Link Prediction Explanations 

A theoretical framing and a set of experiments for the attribution of GML models on the LP task, considering two types of Graph Neural Networks: Variational Graph Auto-Encoders (VGAE) and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN).

Testing explanation methods for GNNs and dependence on Enc/Dec choice.
